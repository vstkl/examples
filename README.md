# Welcome to my github

This is portfolio to demonstrate some of my code for purposes of job interviews, I have published some of the tasks that I have provided for previous interviews.

Does not demonstrate my full skillset.

As I was told, there are histories of commits missing, which is true, because some of repositories I have discovered on old computers from some interesting projects I've done, from the dark ages before I knew versioning, so I guess that's it. (Congratulations to reaching the end of this endless sentence!)
