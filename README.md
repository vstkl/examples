# Welcome to my github

This is portfolio to demonstrate some of my code for purposes of job interviews, I have published some of the tasks that I have provided for previous interviews.

Does not demonstrate my full skillset.

As I was told, some of repositories I dug up from some interesting projects, from the dark ages before I knew versioning, so I guess that's it.
